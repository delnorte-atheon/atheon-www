# About Us

We are the Del Norte Atheon Group, a collective born from the urgent necessity to reclaim our fundamental human right to privacy in an increasingly pervasive digital world.

The inconvenient truth, as noted by whistleblowers like Edward Snowden, is that the vast, unseen apparatus of mass surveillance is very much not a dystopian fantasy, and very much real. Programs like the NSA's PRISM, XKeyscore, TURBULENCE, etc. revealed the staggering capabilities of state actors to *indiscriminately* harvest our communications, track our movements, and catalog our lives. Their scope has extended substantially away from just criminals and terrorists to **watching everyone, all the time**, fundamentally altering the very nature of our liberty.

And it doesn't stop there. Corporations, in their insatiable pursuit of profit, relentlessly engage in anti-consumerist practices that transform our personal data into a commodity. Every click, every search, every purchase, every interaction become a data point to be collected, analyzed, and, of course, monetized. These companies implement pervasive tracking through digital ads to build shadow profiles from our most intimate habits. The narrative of "convenience" masks an unprecedented scale of data harvesting that strips us of our agency and turns our digital lives into exploitable assets.

**Privacy should not be a privilege; it should be a fundamental human right**. To concede to its infringement, whether by government mandate or corporate greed, is to stand on a perilous slippery slope towards a future where surveillance is normalized, dissent is stifled, and the very concept of a private individual is obsolete. Ever read George Orwell's *1984* (or any dystopian book for that matter)?

Therefore, the Del Norte Atheon Group is dedicated to rigorous education and proactive defense of digital rights. We have focus in applied cryptography, OPSEC, and security oriented software projects which we hope will help further our defense against the privacy nightmare that is the current state of affairs.

We build secure systems not to hide, but to refuse perversion by frankly unaccountable powers.
